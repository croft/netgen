To install these files do the following:

  - Create a directory called ".vim" in your home directory and cd there
  - Create a subdirectory called "syntax"
  - Place the pulled "syntax" files into the syntax directory giving them
    the name "logiql.vim" and "logiql_script.vim"
  - Create a subdirectory of ".vim" called "ftdetect"
  - Place the pulled "ftdetect" in the ftdetect directory giving it
    the name "logiql.vim"
  - Place the following line in your "~/.vimrc": syntax on


To change the specific colors used in some rule, if the default is not good enough:

  - Create a subdirectory of ".vim" called "colors"
  - Create a file with the an arbitrary name like "myColours.vim"
  - Add lines as the following to alter the colors used for specific groups

let g:colors_name = "myColours"

highlight Operator           ctermfg=gray

highlight lbVar              ctermfg=darkblue guifg=#ffbf3d gui=bold
highlight lbEngineDirective  ctermfg=yellow cterm=bold ctermbg=darkgreen
highlight lbBuiltInType      ctermfg=blue cterm=NONE

  - You can redefine the color for general groups (e.g. Operator) or specific to
    some filetype (e.g. lbVar for logiQL).
  - A list of the available general groups can be found here
    http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/syntax.html#group-name
  - "cterm" is used for colors in the terminal editor (vim) and "gui" for the GUI version (gvim).
  - "fg" stands for foreground color and "bg" for background color.
  - "cterm" and "gui" (without a "fg"/"bg" suffix) can be used for specific effects (e.g. bold)
  - for the terminal version, a list of available colors can be found here
    http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/syntax.html#highlight-cterm
  - for the GUI version, hex numbers can be used as well

  - add the following line in "~/.vimrc": colorscheme myColours
